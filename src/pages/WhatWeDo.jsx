                                    Lupin, or Onobrychis vicifolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant
                                    found widely in mountain pastures in Kyrgyzstan. It blooms from
                                    May to August, with its countless flowers gathered in long panicle-shaped
                                    inflorescences of intense pink color, attracting bees in a dance of abundance.
                                    From these flowers, they obtain healing White Lupin Honey, belonging to the family
                                    of rare and precious honeys.

                                <b>What is lupin honey?</b>
                                <p>
                                    Beymaral Honey has a characteristic and unmistakable
                                    taste and aroma, with a pleasant floral scent,
                                    especially of roses. Lupin honey offers a taste
                                    characterized by a soft balance between sweetness and
                                    acidity, with a slightly herbaceous aftertaste that sets
                                    it apart. It pairs perfectly with most fruits, fresh cheeses,
                                    white meat dishes, and fish.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                After harvest, the honey’s color initially
                                varies from light golden to a more intense
                                and dark hue. Within 3-4 weeks, the nectar
                                crystallizes rapidly, acquiring a finely granulated
                                and velvety consistency with white shades.

                                    Beymaral Honey stands out not only for the
                                    exceptional quality of its lupin honey but
                                    also for its ethical and sustainable approach
                                    to beekeeping. The company adopts a responsible
                                    practice that respects the natural cycle of bees,
                                    avoiding overexploitation. Our philosophy is based
                                    on fair and sustainable harvesting, ensuring the bees
                                    have enough honey to sustain themselves while supporting
                                    ecosystem balance and bee colony health.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This ethical approach promotes environmental sustainability
                                    and ensures high-quality honey. Respect for the bees’
                                    well-being directly reflects in the honey’s quality, as
                                    healthy bees produce purer and more aromatic honey.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    product while respecting and supporting the environment
